              <h1>Welcome to The Indie Quest!</h1>
              <p>The Indie Quest is a course in programming, art, and production, specifically designed for creating indie games. Instead of studying individual subjects in isolation, you acquire the skills directly by using them on game projects. You will first become an apprentice, completing carefully designed game coding missions that will build your programming knowledge step-by-step.</p>
              <p>You will then extend these foundations by learning advanced concepts while creating your own games. Applying project management strategies will help you prototype your ideas and polish the end result to share your games with the world.
